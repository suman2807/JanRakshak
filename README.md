# JanRakshak

“जनRAKSHAK” is an AI-powered crowd safety system that analyzes real-time movement patterns to detect dangerous overcrowding, abnormal behavior, and potential stampede risks before they escalate. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning, “जनRAKSHAK” provides a proactive solution to prevent stampedes, protect lives, and ensure safer public gatherings worldwide.

#What if you could predict a stampede before it even happens?
Our solution doesn’t just analyze crowds—it understands them.
We’ve built an intelligent system that sees the warning signs, acts instantly, and evolves on its own

#A Smart Shield for the Masses
Detects early signs of aggression, panic, and stampedes — in real-time
Visualizes danger zones with Generative AI overlays
Makes split-second decisions with Agentic AI autonomy
Learns and adapts with Reinforcement Learning — gets smarter with every frame

#Impact That Speaks for Itself
Every second saved = lives protected
Thousands can be monitored with zero manual effort
Alerts that aren’t just triggered — they're strategically generated
Ready to plug into any surveillance system, anywhere

#Why It Stands Out
This isn’t just a detection system —
It’s a 24/7 intelligent safety companion that watches, thinks, and acts.
From crowd chaos to controlled calm ,Our solution is the difference between a warning and a tragedy!
